# How to not be sleepy or whatever from airplanes

A comprehensive guide.

## Introduction

Air travel is the worst. I hate it. Most importantly, I hate the way I feel afterwards, when my body thinks that it is one time,
but it is actually another time. This will serve as a guide for all the hacks that have worked for me or other people.
It will mainly be from the point of view of a trip from the continental United States to somewhere in Europe.
But the principles can be broadly applied to any trip where your baseline time changes more than 1-2 hours.

## What is the problem, exactly?

I think it is quite important to understand what is happening and why your body doesn't just switch over to a new baseline time easily.
For whatever reason, the powers that be have decided that humans, in order to survive for generations,
our gestalt is such that we can more effectively hunt, gather or do agriculture during the day.
This means we have to adopt a diurnal lifestyle, where we are attuned to the day/night dichotomy, being awake when it is light out
and asleep (hopefully) when it is night.
Our body is quite helpful in setting this rhythm, which is called the circadian rhythm.
There is a bundle of nerves called the supra-chiasmatic nuclei (SCN) somewhere in your hypothalamus that is sort of a central processer for all your
body's clues about what time of day it is.
It sort of turns on and off slowly over the course of the day, telling your body, the individual cells, that it is now time to be awake/asleep.
If you remove the SCN, by the way, you lose all sense of circadian rhythm. This is a fun prank to play on a roomate, say.
So we have this thing in our body that sort of goes on and off, telling your body to stay in tune with this daily rhythm.

However, the SCN is not neccessarily in tune with the world.
If you deprive a human being of all sorts of clues about what time it actually is, i.e. keep them in a box where the light is always on,
the temperature stays the same and there is always food, well a typical human does not keep a 24 hour cycle!
People's internal rhythm, independant of external clues can be something 23.2 hours a day.
So left to our own devices, we'll sort of stay up later and later and sleep later and later.
So despite the fact that you have an internal means of creating a rhythm, you have to use external cues to keep nudging the cycle to its 24 hour rhythm.

So to summarize - there is a part of our body that tells our body when it is awake-time or asleep-time, which is used to getting gradual nudges,
to the order of let's say 15 minutes a day in order to stay in tune with the 24 hour days.
So let's say you've flown from Chicago to Paris. When it is 8:00 AM in Paris, your body still thinks that it is midnight and
you will want to sleep forever. Then when you try to go to sleep at 8:00 PM, your body thinks that it is noon and you will have trouble falling asleep.

I hope this wasn't boring, but I think it's important to understand what we are up against.
But now we can understand the clues that the body uses to nudge the clock and hopefully accelerate them.

## Internal Clues and their external Stimuli

### Melatonin

The number one most important thing to your circadian sleep cycle is the hormone melatonin. 
Melatonin makes you feel sleepy.
While light is shining on your retinas, the SCN tells your pineal gland to stop producing melatonin.
But as sunset approaches, less light hits your retinas, well then the message becomes to start producing melatonin.
So light is basically the most important thing when it comes to melatonin production.
In fact, when you have super blind people who have absolutely no sensitivity to light, then they have basically no circadian rhythm.
In normal situations, it seems that the nexus, timing and intensity of light is important as well.
In the AM, you want to have very bright light that comes from above.
Near the evening, you want to have dim light that comes from below your eye level.

What is also important, as far as melatonin is concerned, is that there is an impulse of melatonin. 
It isn't so much that there is a general rise of melatonin in your blood and when it builds up, well it's time for sleep.
Rather, at around 9, your pineal gland switches on and your bloodstream gets flooded with melatonin and then a few hours later
you get really sleepy.
